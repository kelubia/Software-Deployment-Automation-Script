# Software-Deployment-Automation-Script
Description:
This single Bash script that installs a software package across Linux, Windows, and macOS, it detects the operating system and executes the appropriate installation function based on it. I would need to fill in the installation commands for Windows based on the package manager I choose (e.g., Chocolatey).
